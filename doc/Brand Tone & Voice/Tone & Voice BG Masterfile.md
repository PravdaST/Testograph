# **TestoUp: Brand Tone & Voice Masterfile (Final)**

**Objective:** To define the persuasive personality of the TestoUp brand. This guide operationalizes our core voice—the **"Honest and Empowering Coach"**—by filtering it through Alex Hormozi's Value Equation framework. The result is a tone that is not only aspirational but also creates undeniable value and urgency in the customer's mind.

## **Part 1: Our Core Voice \- The Strategic Foundation**

Our unchanging personality remains the **"Honest and Empowering Coach."** This is our ethical North Star. It ensures our "dream-selling" never becomes baseless hype, thereby protecting our most valuable brand asset: **Trust**.

* **Honest:** We are clear, direct, and transparent. We don't use confusing jargon.  
* **Empowering:** We are supportive partners. We give the customer the plan and tools to become the hero of his own story.  
* **Coach:** We are knowledgeable and confident experts who guide our customers to a successful, guaranteed outcome.

## **Part 2: Our Persuasive Tone \- The Hormozi Value Equation Engine**

Our tone is the application of our voice. To make it "dream-selling," we will structure all copy around maximizing the variables in Hormozi's Value Equation. This is the engine of our persuasion.

**Value \= (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood of Achievement) / (Time Delay × Effort & Sacrifice)**

### **1\. Maximizing the Dream Outcome (↑)**

We don't sell capsules; we sell a return to the throne. Our language must articulate the customer's deepest desires for status, power, and identity so clearly that they feel profoundly understood. We channel the desire that already exists.

| Persona | Dream Outcome | "Dream Selling" Copy Angle |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **The Stoic Provider** | To be the **Unshakable Bedrock (Опора)** | *"Imagine the absolute certainty of knowing you have the relentless energy to be the rock your family depends on—not just a provider, but their powerful, present, and unwavering center."* |
| **Performance Optimizer** | To become the **Unstoppable Athlete** | *"This is your unfair advantage. While others stay stuck, you will shatter your limits. This is the blueprint for building the elite physique that commands respect and proves your dedication."* |
| **Intimacy Restorer** | To be the **Desired Partner** | *"This isn't about a pill, it's about reclaiming the connection you thought was lost forever. This is the path back to intimacy, confidence, and becoming the man she fell in love with."* |
| **Vitality Seeker** | To be the **Generative Man** | *"This is not about 'getting old.' This is about taking control and re-igniting the vitality that allows you to live life on your terms, not as a spectator, but as the main character."* |
| **Confidence Builder** | To be the **Visible & Confident Man** | *"Stop feeling invisible. This is the system to build the powerful, defined physique that gives you the unshakable confidence to be seen, respected, and desired."* |

### **2\. Maximizing Perceived Likelihood of Achievement (↑)**

We must obliterate doubt and build absolute certainty that our system will work for them. We do this by using proof, authority, and, most importantly, a powerful guarantee that reverses all risk.

* **Authoritative Language:** *"Our clinically-studied ingredients are precisely formulated into a proven protocol designed to optimize your body's natural systems."*  
* **Leverage Proof:** *"Join over 1,200 Bulgarian men who have already started their transformation."* / *"As recommended by leading Bulgarian health expert \[Expert Name\]..."*  
* **Deploy the "Unbreakable Guarantee" (Hormozi-Style Risk Reversal):** This is our most powerful conversion tool.  
  * **Headline:** The TestoUp Unbreakable Guarantee  
  * **Body:** *"Our guarantee is simple: Follow the TestoUp Protocol for 30 days. If you don't experience a tangible improvement in your energy, power, and confidence, we insist you get a full refund. But we'll go one step further. We'll also let you keep the entire 30-day supply and all the bonus guides, on us. That's how confident we are that this system will work for you. The risk is 100% on us."*

### **3\. Minimizing Time Delay (↓)**

We sell speed. People will always pay for speed. The transformation begins *now*.

* **Emphasize Immediacy:**  
  * *"Start feeling the difference in your energy levels in as little as 7 days."*  
  * *"Why wait to reclaim your vitality? Your 30-day transformation starts the moment you place your order."*  
  * *"Your personalized vitality analysis is free and takes less than 60 seconds."*

### **4\. Minimizing Effort & Sacrifice (↓)**

Our system must be positioned as the clear, simple, and easy path to their dream outcome.

* **Frame as Effortless:** *"No complicated diets. No impossible workout plans. Just two capsules a day and our simple protocols to unlock your results."*  
* **Position as the "Done-For-You" Solution:** *"Stop the guesswork. We've done the research for you. The TestoUp system is the complete, science-backed solution delivered directly to your door."*

## **Part 3: Word Bank & Lexicon**

This is our arsenal of approved language. It ensures every word reinforces our "dream-selling" tone.

| Use These Power Words ✅ | Instead of These Weak Words ❌ |
| :---- | :---- |
| The System, The Protocol, The Blueprint | Our Product, The Supplement |
| Reclaim, Restore, Unleash, Command, Unlock | Help, Try, Assist, Support |

## **Part 4: Tonal Application for Offers (The Hormozi Offer Stack)**

Our tone must adapt to create a buying frenzy when presenting offers.

* **Scarcity (Quantity-Based):** The tone becomes exclusive and urgent.  
  * *"This month, we are only accepting 100 new men into the TestoUp Protocol to ensure each gets our full attention. Spots are filling fast."*  
* **Urgency (Time-Based):** The tone becomes time-sensitive and decisive.  
  * *"This introductory price is only guaranteed until Friday at midnight. After that, it's gone for good."*  
* **Bonuses (Value Stacking):** The tone becomes overwhelmingly generous. We list each bonus as a separate, high-value item to make the final price seem like a bargain.  
  * *"When you order today, you don't just get the 30-day TestoUp system. You also get IMMEDIATE access to: The Elite Performance Nutrition Guide (a 99 лв value), The 7-Day Energy Kickstart Protocol (a 69 лв value), and our private community of high-performers (Priceless)... all for FREE."*  
* **Naming (The Wrapper):** We use Hormozi's M-A-G-I-C formula to name our offers, making them sound like an unmissable event.  
  * **Example Name:** The 30-Day Vitality Reclamation Challenge  
  * **Breakdown:** (M) Reclaim your vitality, (A) For Bulgarian men over 35, (G) Restore your energy, (I) in 30 days, (C) Challenge.
